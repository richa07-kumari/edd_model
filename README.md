This use case is basically predicting the estimated delivery date of the orders placed within United States based on various parameter like location, dimension, holday constrains, etc. I have divided trhe complete use case in 6 phase: Starting from synthetic data generation, data cleaning, feature engineering, defining four models, comparing each based on the loss function and then picking up the best fit model and then run a new order over this model to predict the final delivery date.
